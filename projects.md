  Energy Advisor Project Summary: Developed an AI-powered EcoHome Energy Advisor agent using LangGraph
  and LangChain to optimize smart home energy consumption. Integrated multiple tools for weather
  forecasts, dynamic electricity pricing, and historical usage data, alongside a RAG pipeline for
  energy-saving tips. Implemented comprehensive testing and evaluation metrics, enabling personalized
  recommendations for EV charging, thermostat settings, appliance scheduling, and solar power
  maximization, resulting in significant cost savings and reduced environmental impact.

  Building Agents Project Summary: Developed an automated review system for Udacity's "Building Agents"
   nanodegree, utilizing an Orchestrator-Worker pattern with specialized Claude sub-agents
  (RubricAgent, CriterionAgent, FeedbackAgent). This system transforms manual evaluation into an
  autonomous, scalable process by evaluating student submissions against defined rubrics, generating
  detailed feedback, and ensuring consistent assessment. The project involved designing agents for
  contextual separation, flexible permissions, and chaining, demonstrating advanced LLM interaction
  patterns for complex workflows like video outlining and code review.

  Betty Bird Boutique Project Summary: Developed an AI customer service agent for a pet store using
  Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), integrating a Cloud SQL MySQL product database, a Vertex AI
  Search document search tool for PDFs, and a Google Search web search tool. The project focused on
  building a robust agent with error handling, session management, and guardrails to answer diverse
  customer queries about store information, products, and bird care. Successfully implemented and
  configured all core functionalities, with a detailed checklist for deployment and resource
  management.

  Knowledge Agents Project Summary: Developed UDA-Hub, a production-ready, LangGraph-powered
  multi-agent customer support system for CultPass, a fitness membership platform. The system features
  four specialized AI agents (Classifier, Resolver, Supervisor, Escalation) that intelligently handle
  support tickets, leveraging a dual-database architecture for customer and application data,
  comprehensive memory management, and sophisticated workflow orchestration. Implemented
  confidence-based routing, robust error handling, and a three-tier memory system for context
  awareness, achieving an 85.7% rubric compliance and demonstrating intelligent classification,
  personalized responses, and multi-factor escalation logic.

  Finance Agent Project Summary: Developed a modern financial agent capable of multi-tool coordination,
   integrating 6 specialized tools (3 document-based for 10-K analysis and 3 function-based for SQL
  queries, market data, and PII protection). Implemented natural language to SQL conversion, real-time
  market data integration via Yahoo Finance, automatic PII masking, and LLM-based intelligent tool
  selection and response synthesis. The project focused on building an agent to analyze financial
  documents, query databases, and provide insights on company performance and customer holdings.

  Travel Agent Project Summary: Developed an automated review system for Udacity's "Travel Agent"
  project, utilizing a sub-agent architecture with an Orchestrator-Worker pattern to evaluate student
  submissions. The system features specialized agents for workspace management, rubric interpretation,
  criterion analysis, and context engineering, ensuring isolated and evidence-based assessment of
  travel itinerary generation and refinement. Implemented domain-specific agents for travel itinerary
  creation, weather compatibility, and ReAct-based itinerary revision, focusing on prompt design, agent
   reasoning, structured output validation, and multi-agent coordination within the travel domain.

  SWIFT Agent Project Summary: Developed a SWIFT transaction processing system leveraging advanced AI
  agent patterns, including Evaluator-Optimizer for message validation and correction, Parallelization
  for concurrent fraud detection, Prompt Chaining for enhanced fraud analysis, and Orchestrator-Worker
  for high-value transaction processing. The system orchestrates a multi-step pipeline to generate,
  validate, and analyze SWIFT messages, demonstrating robust fraud detection and efficient transaction
  handling through modular agent design.

  UdaciSense Model Optimization Project Summary: Led the UdaciSense Model Optimization project,
  achieving an 89.4% model size reduction (5.83 MB to 0.62 MB) and a 70% inference speed improvement
  for neural networks, exceeding CTO targets for mobile deployment. Implemented a multi-stage
  compression pipeline combining knowledge distillation, magnitude-based pruning, and dynamic
  quantization, resulting in a production-ready TorchScript mobile package. The project focused on
  transforming cloud-dependent AI into efficient, cross-platform mobile solutions, significantly
  reducing cloud costs, expanding market reach to budget smartphones, and enhancing user experience
  with real-time, offline capabilities.
