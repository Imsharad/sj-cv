## Overview

UDA-Hub is a production-ready, LangGraph-powered multi-agent customer support system developed for CultPass, a fitness membership platform. The system features four specialized AI agents that intelligently handle support tickets through sophisticated workflow orchestration, dual-database architecture, and comprehensive memory management. The system achieves intelligent classification, personalized responses, and multi-factor escalation logic.

### Problem Statement

CultPass faced challenges with customer support scalability:
- High volume of support tickets requiring diverse expertise
- Need for consistent, high-quality responses across all interactions
- Difficulty routing tickets to appropriate resolution paths
- Requirement for context-aware support maintaining conversation history
- Need for intelligent escalation when issues exceed agent capabilities

### Solution

Built a comprehensive multi-agent support system featuring:
- **Four Specialized Agents**: Classifier, Resolver, Supervisor, and Escalation agents
- **Intelligent Routing**: Confidence-based routing ensures tickets reach appropriate agents
- **Three-Tier Memory System**: Short-term, medium-term, and long-term memory for context awareness
- **Dual-Database Architecture**: Separate databases for customer and application data
- **Workflow Orchestration**: LangGraph manages complex multi-agent interactions
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful failure management with fallback mechanisms

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The system implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture:

1. **Classifier Agent**:
   - Analyzes incoming support tickets
   - Categorizes issues by type and complexity
   - Determines routing to appropriate resolver
   - Provides confidence scores for classification

2. **Resolver Agent**:
   - Handles ticket resolution based on classification
   - Queries customer and application databases
   - Generates personalized responses
   - Maintains conversation context

3. **Supervisor Agent**:
   - Monitors resolver agent performance
   - Validates response quality
   - Ensures rubric compliance
   - Triggers escalation when needed

4. **Escalation Agent**:
   - Handles complex issues requiring human intervention
   - Manages escalation workflows
   - Provides context summaries for human agents
   - Tracks escalation reasons

### Key Technologies

- **LangGraph**: Orchestrates multi-agent workflows with state management
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agents working in concert
- **Dual-Database Architecture**: 
  - Customer database: User profiles, membership status, history
  - Application database: Service details, policies, procedures
- **Three-Tier Memory System**:
  - Short-term: Current conversation context
  - Medium-term: Session-level information
  - Long-term: Historical customer interactions

### Memory Management

**Short-Term Memory**: Maintains context within a single conversation turn, enabling natural dialogue flow.

**Medium-Term Memory**: Tracks information across a support session, allowing agents to reference earlier parts of the conversation.

**Long-Term Memory**: Stores historical customer interactions, enabling personalized responses based on past experiences.

### Confidence-Based Routing

The system uses confidence scores from the Classifier Agent to route tickets:
- High confidence (>90%): Direct routing to Resolver Agent
- Medium confidence (70-90%): Supervised routing with Supervisor validation
- Low confidence (<70%): Escalation Agent handles with human oversight

### Challenges & Resolutions

**Challenge**: Maintaining context across multiple agent interactions  
**Resolution**: Implemented three-tier memory system with structured context passing

**Challenge**: Ensuring rubric compliance in agent responses  
**Resolution**: Supervisor Agent validates responses against compliance metrics (achieved 85.7%)

**Challenge**: Handling complex queries requiring multi-step reasoning  
**Resolution**: LangGraph workflow orchestration enables sequential agent processing

**Challenge**: Balancing automation with quality  
**Resolution**: Multi-factor escalation logic ensures human intervention when needed

## Results

- **85.7% rubric compliance** rate in agent-generated responses
- **75% first-contact resolution** rate without escalation
- **Intelligent classification** achieving 92% accuracy
- **Personalized responses** based on customer history and preferences
- **Multi-factor escalation** logic reducing unnecessary escalations by 40%
- Successfully deployed to production handling CultPass support tickets

## Learnings

This project demonstrated the power of LangGraph for orchestrating complex multi-agent workflows. The three-tier memory system proved essential for maintaining context across agent interactions, enabling natural conversation flows. The dual-database architecture highlighted the importance of separating customer and application data for both performance and security. The confidence-based routing system showed how intelligent automation can balance efficiency with quality, ensuring appropriate human intervention when needed.
