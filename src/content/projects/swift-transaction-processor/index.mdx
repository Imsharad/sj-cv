## Overview

The SWIFT Transaction Processor is an advanced AI-powered system for processing SWIFT financial messages with sophisticated fraud detection capabilities. The system leverages multiple AI agent patterns including Evaluator-Optimizer for message validation and correction, Parallelization for concurrent fraud detection, Prompt Chaining for enhanced fraud analysis, and Orchestrator-Worker for high-value transaction processing. The system orchestrates a multi-step pipeline to generate, validate, and analyze SWIFT messages, demonstrating robust fraud detection and efficient transaction handling.

### Problem Statement

SWIFT transaction processing faces critical challenges:
- High volume of transactions requiring rapid processing
- Complex fraud detection requiring multiple analysis layers
- Need for message validation and correction
- Requirement for parallel processing to handle throughput
- Critical need for accuracy in financial transactions

### Solution

Built a comprehensive transaction processing system featuring:
- **Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern**: Validates and corrects SWIFT messages
- **Parallel Fraud Detection**: Concurrent analysis across multiple dimensions
- **Prompt Chaining**: Sequential analysis for complex fraud patterns
- **Orchestrator-Worker Pattern**: Coordinates high-value transaction processing
- **Multi-Step Pipeline**: End-to-end processing from generation to validation
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful failure management for financial operations

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The system implements multiple AI agent patterns:

1. **Message Generation Agent**:
   - Creates SWIFT messages from transaction data
   - Validates format compliance
   - Ensures required fields are present

2. **Evaluator-Optimizer Agents**:
   - **Evaluator**: Validates message correctness and compliance
   - **Optimizer**: Corrects identified issues and improves message quality
   - Iterative refinement until message meets standards

3. **Parallel Fraud Detection Agents**:
   - **Amount Analysis Agent**: Detects anomalous transaction amounts
   - **Pattern Matching Agent**: Identifies suspicious transaction patterns
   - **Historical Analysis Agent**: Compares against historical transaction data
   - **Risk Scoring Agent**: Calculates overall transaction risk score

4. **Prompt Chaining Agent**:
   - Sequences multiple analysis steps
   - Builds comprehensive fraud assessment
   - Synthesizes results from parallel agents

5. **Orchestrator-Worker Pattern**:
   - **Orchestrator**: Coordinates high-value transaction processing
   - **Worker Agents**: Perform specialized validation tasks
   - **Aggregation**: Combines worker results for final decision

### Key Technologies

- **Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern**: Iterative validation and improvement
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent fraud detection across dimensions
- **Prompt Chaining**: Sequential analysis building on previous results
- **Orchestrator-Worker**: Coordinated multi-agent workflows
- **SWIFT Message Format**: Compliance with financial messaging standards

### Fraud Detection Pipeline

1. **Initial Validation**: Message format and compliance check
2. **Parallel Analysis**: Simultaneous fraud detection across multiple dimensions
3. **Risk Aggregation**: Combines scores from parallel agents
4. **Deep Analysis**: Prompt chaining for complex patterns
5. **Final Decision**: Orchestrator coordinates final approval/rejection

### Challenges & Resolutions

**Challenge**: Balancing processing speed with thorough fraud detection  
**Resolution**: Parallel agent execution enables comprehensive analysis without latency increase

**Challenge**: Ensuring message format compliance  
**Resolution**: Evaluator-Optimizer pattern iteratively refines messages until compliant
